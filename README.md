### A Tetris game written in Kotlin, intended to be used with Android.

The core engine of the game is designed to be decoupled from the user interface and provide greater flexibility for UI design.

Development is largely complete, and I am now focusing mostly on improving performance and fixing bugs.

The application is not yet published on Play Store, but I intend to do so after I feel it is stable and more complete.
